// Create the constructor for a Person object

// Create a new User object constructor

// e.g. being able to call the super class constructor
this.name = name;
this.password = password;
};

oldUser = new User("first User", "first_User");

// The User object inherits all of the Person object's methods
User.prototype = new Person();
// Same Effetc of the above line
//User.prototype = Person.prototype; 

// We add a method of our own to the User object
User.prototype.getPassword = function() {

NewUser = new User("a", "a");

// alert("Old User : " + oldUser.getName()); --> this will cause an error, getName is not method of oldUser
alert("New User Name:" + NewUser.getName());
alert("New User Password: " + NewUser.getPassword());

oldUser = NewUser;
// This will work, as oldUser became identical to NewUser including its properties & methods
alert("Old User Name: "+oldUser.getName());




/***
The most important line in the example is User.prototype = new Person();.
Let’s look in depth at what exactly this means. User is a reference to the function constructor
of the User object. new Person() creates a new Person object, using the Person constructor.
You set the result of this as the value of the User constructor’s prototype. This means that anytime
you do new User(), the new User object will have all the methods that the Person object
had when you did new Person().
